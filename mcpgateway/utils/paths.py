Shared request-path and filesystem-path utilities for ContextForge.

Some embedded/proxy deployments do not populate ``scope["root_path"]``
consistently.  This module provides a single canonical helper that checks
the ASGI scope first and falls back to ``settings.app_root_path`` when the
scope value is empty — the same logic that was previously private to
``mcpgateway/admin.py`` (issue #3298).

All call sites that previously read ``request.scope.get("root_path", "")``
directly should use :func:`resolve_root_path` instead.

    Values containing control characters, URL scheme markers, or query/fragment
    delimiters are sanitised to an empty string (with a warning log) to prevent

    This is the canonical directory-confinement check for ContextForge.  It must be
    used instead of ``str(candidate).startswith(str(root))``: a plain string prefix
    comparison has no notion of a path-component boundary, so a *sibling* directory
    that merely shares a textual prefix (``/srv/logs_secret`` vs. root ``/srv/logs``)
    passes the prefix test while living entirely outside the intended tree.

    Both arguments are expected to be already resolved (``Path.resolve()``) by the
    caller, so that symlinks and ``..`` segments have been collapsed before the
    comparison.  The check itself is purely lexical and touches no filesystem.

    Args:
        candidate: Resolved path to test.
        root: Resolved directory that *candidate* must not escape.

    Returns:
        ``True`` when *candidate* is *root* itself or lives beneath it, else ``False``.

    Examples:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> is_path_within(Path("/srv/logs/app.log"), Path("/srv/logs"))

        A sibling directory sharing a textual prefix is correctly rejected, where a
