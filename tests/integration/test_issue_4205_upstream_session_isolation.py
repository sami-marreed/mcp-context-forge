Integration reproducer for issue #4205 — upstream session isolation.
The original reproducer (Dawid Nowak, issue #4205): start a stateful MCP
server (rust-sdk counter example), register it with ContextForge, then
drive multiple downstream MCP sessions through the gateway. Before this
fix, ContextForge's identity-keyed session pool shared a single upstream
session across downstream clients carrying the same user identity, so
every client saw — and mutated — the same counter. Increment from one
browser tab leaked into another; resetting the counter was effectively
impossible.
This test recreates that scenario at the integration layer using:
  * the real ``UpstreamSessionRegistry`` (the 1:1 replacement for the
    deleted ``MCPSessionPool``);
  * an in-memory stateful counter that plays the role of the upstream
    MCP server, wired in via the registry's injectable SessionFactory;
  * two downstream sessions identified by different ``Mcp-Session-Id``s.
The load-bearing assertion is that counter state never leaks across
downstream sessions. If the registry's 1:1 contract ever regresses, the
``increment(5) … increment(3) … get_counter`` sequence below sees the
combined count and this test fails loudly, in the exact shape of the
original bug report.
